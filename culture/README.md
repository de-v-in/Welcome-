### 1. The masterpiece that need to have in everyday life. Nobody is perfect, everyone can be wrong and life still goes on; so if we want to WIN together, we need to RESPECT others from the core of our thought.

### 2. Feels negative -> say how you feel, feels inspired -> speak to share motivations, feels disconnected -> talk to your team. Verbally problems? Email people, yep, we only WIN when we COMMUNICATE as a team.

### 3. We make product run, we achieve high standards, we are professional engineers/developers. WORK until our products WIN the market.

### 4. This looks familiar to RESPECT, but actually reinforce our edge cases. What if the project failed entirely? what if someone ruins the product in the last minutes? what if we can't make profit? Can we sit back and find our saviors? Or, we will quit? EMPATHIZE is about relieving and understanding; we can't WIN if we never LOSE.
